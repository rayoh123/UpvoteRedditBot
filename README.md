# UpvoteRedditBot
Use this bot for generating hundreds of comment upvotes. 

Download and put the "details.py" and "script.py" modules in the same directory. Then, edit the "details.py" module so it contains your Reddit account's credentials. You will need to make a new "app" on your Reddit account and put it's credentials in "details.py" as well.  Finally, run the script to generate posts in r/FreeKarma4U.
